# Alignments

I used this webpage to learn about the algorithm: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/SumSchool/materials/sources/tutorials/07-bioinformatics/seqlab-html/node6.html

My next step is to make the gap penalty actually count for something, probably by having the algorithm output a series of different possible alignments and then rank them based on gaps and gap extension. Whilst I have some thoughts about how to make my alignment algorithm output the different alignments I can't help feeling there must be a quick and easy way to do it. I still need to give this some thought before I start writing something.
